# Sales Forecasting & Demand Prediction

## Overview
With the increasing demands and intense competition in the market, businesses need to understand which products, regions, categories, and customer segments to target for maximizing sales and profitability. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to forecast sales and predict demand based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from a Superstore and contains detailed transactional data. The dataset includes various attributes such as order details, customer information, product details, and financial metrics.

### Metadata
The dataset consists of the following features:
- **Row ID**: Unique ID for each row.
- **Order ID**: Unique Order ID for each customer.
- **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed.
- **Ship Date**: Date when the order was shipped.
- **Ship Mode**: Shipping mode selected by the customer.
- **Customer ID**: Unique ID assigned to each customer.
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer.
- **Segment**: The segment to which the customer belongs.
- **Country**: Country of residence of the customer.
- **City**: City of residence of the customer.
- **State**: State of residence of the customer.
- **Postal Code**: Postal code of the customer.
- **Region**: Region where the customer belongs.
- **Product ID**: Unique ID of the product.
- **Category**: Category of the ordered product.
- **Sub-Category**: Sub-category of the ordered product.
- **Product Name**: Name of the product.
- **Sales**: Sales revenue from the product.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of the product sold.
- **Discount**: Discount applied to the product.
- **Profit**: Profit or loss incurred from the sale.

## Project Objectives
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Prepare and transform data for modeling.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Use regression models to predict future sales.
- **Demand Prediction**: Identify factors affecting demand for different products and customer segments.
- **Business Insights**: Provide actionable insights for improving sales and profitability.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Analysis & Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)
- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning Models, if applicable)
- Tableau/Power BI (Data Visualization)

## Getting Started
